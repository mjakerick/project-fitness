# Project-fitness

Fitness Tracking Application: (https://project-fitness-log.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

Project fitness is a fitness tracker meant to log a user's progress on their fitness journey.

## Technologies Used

Project Fitness was built using HTML, CSS, and Angular. The app also uses AngularJS to make AJAX-like calls to a database.

## Challenges

This project was meant to be a group project, but unfortunately I had a graduation to attend for my younger sister, which caused me to miss over half of the project working days due to travelling(driving from San Diego to Berkeley and back). Because of this, my instructor and I decided that rather than hinder my group by being unable to work, I should attempt the project solo.

## Unfinished Business

I would've liked to add different forms based on the type of exercise preformed so that I user could log sets, reps, calories, laps, distance, time, etc. depending on what would be most relevant for the exercise.

I also would have liked to add a more attractive way to display the user's data using graphs or some type of charting to make the user's progress more visual.

I only added some very subtle styling to the app. One of my main goals for this project was to really spend some time making it look nice, but I didn't really get the chance... I'd like to revisit this project in the future.

## Set Backs

With less than two days to complete a six day project. I decided to focus on the most important features like user authentication, logging in and logging out, being able to create, edit, and delete logs and using universal forms to log a variety of exercises.

I spent a significant amount of time working through connecting a user to their data. I finally found a solution, but this took out a large chunk of time that I wanted to spend on features to make this app shine.
